# Java API

I had to write simple html and js that uses [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to perform [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on a json API for a college assignment. For the lack of a free API that would enable unlimited access to every operation we had to accomplish, I developed this API using [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
It accesses the same [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database as my previous Springboot project, [JavaBackend](https://github.com/edu9988/JavaBackend/). Originally hosted at [render.com](https://render.com/) for a free month ([https://javaapi-d1ez.onrender.com/](https://javaapi-d1ez.onrender.com/)).
